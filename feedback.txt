If a user clicks "Read More" on the primary column:

have the text in the <p> tag slide down along with a "Read Less" link in the blog post using $.slideDown() and $.show()
 - Good!
hide the "Read More" link using $.hide()
 - Good!
If a user clicks "Read Less" on the primary column:

have the <p> slide up and hide the "Read Less" link using $.slideUp() and $.hide()
 - Good!
show the "Read More" link using $.show()
 - Good!
Using the same functions as above, if a user clicks the "Learn More" link in the sidebar, have the <span> inside that <p> slide down and hide the "Learn More" link using $.slideDown() and $.hide()
 - Good!

 Additional Comments:

 - Overall, looking good. Your javascript is well formatted and mostly behaving correctly. There is some strange behavior because you don't need to use both "slideDown()" and "show()". One or the other is fine. Using slideDown() has the same effect as calling show(), it just adds a little sliding animation. The same goes for "hide()" and "slideUp()", you only need one.
